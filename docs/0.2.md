# Beta 0.2 Release Notes

This is the second Sketchbook beta release, and includes a number of new features and improvements. Sketchbook has now reached (and exceeded) parity with the [legacy prototype](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook-legacy), and all creative work from the legacy version has been ported into [a fork](https://longitude.studio) of the new Sketchbook.

## What's New in 0.2

-   **Presets!** Create curated sets of values for your project parameters, and easily switch between them in the app UI. Learn more in [the docs](https://skbk.cc/#/params-presets?id=presets-in-sketchbook).
-   **Config Annotations for Parameters.** You can now specify configuration settings for your parameters with commented annotations, and some config details will be inferred from parameter naming as well. Find more details and examples in [the docs](http://localhost:3000/#/param-config).
-   **Mobile Mode.** Sketchbook now offers a narrow-screen mode for mobile web. Mobile Mode currently supports only project and preset selection (not parameter adjustment), but this enables a nicely streamlined UI.
-   **Shader Art Improvements.** Shader art projects have a few new features, including `scaledTime` uniforms for continuous motion speed adjustments, and `#import` support. See [the docs](http://localhost:3000/#/project-subtypes?id=shader-art) for more.
-   **New Project Config Settings.** Create non-animated projects in `staticMode`, avoid the parameterization of specific project properties with `ignoreKeys`, and more, all listed out in [the docs](https://skbk.cc/#/project-config).
-   **Server Side Rendering.** Sketchbook now renders part of the app on the server, for faster load times and improved performance w/ web scrapers. The project navigation panel renders in SSR (with a blank canvas), then the project and project detail panel are loaded on the client.
-   **Link Preview Support.** You can now bundle OpenGraph images and specify other OG metadata for Sketchbook. Find further discussion in [the docs](https://skbk.cc/#/content?id=open-graph-content).
-   **Hello World Project.** Though most demo projects are still on the [demo branch](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/tree/demo/src/art), the main branch now has one "Hello World" project to welcome newcomers, and provide an example of basic Sketchbook usage.
-   **Quality of Life Improvements.** Many subtle tweaks for improved DX. Examples include: dynamic canvas creation on project load (no more shared canvases), new utility fields in the detail object passed to the `update` function, hex string definitions for numeric array color parameters, and WebGL2 support.
-   **Performance & Stability.** More unit & component tests, bug fixes, style polish, cross-browser testing, and edge-case accommodations have Sketchbook feeling reasonably solid and snappy. More to do here, but progress nonetheless!
-   **Docs Updates:** The Sketchbook Docs provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of Sketchbook's functionality. Changes include improvements to the [Quick Start](http://localhost:3000/#/quick-start), a roadmap overview in the [Beta Notes](http://localhost:3000/#/beta-testing) doc, and many more subtle refinements.

## Breaking Changes (0.1 to 0.2)

-   Numeric array color styles are now named `byteColor` and `unitColor`.
-   The `time` value passed within `UpdateDetail` is now in seconds (instead of milliseconds).
-   The project lifecycle method `paramsChanged` has been renamed, and now receives an array of changed `keys`. It is called only once when multiple params are updated (e.g. on preset application), and is no longer called after function parameter invocations, or after asset import.
