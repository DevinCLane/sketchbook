# App Settings

Sketchbook offers a number of settings that influence the behavior of the web app. Each of these settings can be configured within `src/config/settings.ts`, and also can be added to the "Settings" UI, shown by clicking the settings button at the bottom of the project list panel. For each setting, you can choose whether or not it is shown in the Settings pane, and set default values as you see fit.

See the `settings.ts` file [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/src/config/settings.ts) or in your code editor for commented descriptions of each option, and configure your preferences by editing this file in your Sketchbook. You can also experiment with any of these settings in Sketchbook's [demo deployment](https://demo.skbk.cc).

_[todo: probably list out and describe all available app settings in this document.]_
