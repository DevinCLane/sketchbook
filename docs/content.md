# Content & Copy

You can configure text, button icons, and other content shown throughout the Sketchbook app in `src/config/content.ts`. See the `content.ts` file [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/src/config/content.ts) or in your code editor for commented descriptions of each option, and configure your preferences by editing this file in your Sketchbook.

_[todo: probably list out and describe all available content choices in this document.]_
