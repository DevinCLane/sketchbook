# Content & Copy

You can configure text, button icons, and other content shown throughout the Sketchbook app in `src/config/content.ts`. See the `content.ts` file [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/src/config/content.ts) or in your code editor for commented descriptions of each option, and configure your preferences by editing this file in your Sketchbook.

_[todo: probably list out and describe all available content choices in this document.]_

You may also wish to change your Sketchbook's favicon from the default [OpenMoji icon](https://openmoji.org/library/emoji-1F5BC/). To do so, replace the related icon files in the `static` directory, following the helpful advice on [this page](https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-using-svg-favicons-yet-a-guide-for-modern-browsers-836a6aace3df).
