# Theme & Styling

Sketchbook's visual appearance can be deeply customized by changing the many SCSS variables within `src/config/theme.scss`. The styling system in Sketchbook has been designed to be as customizable as possible, without requiring any additional styling code: typography, colors, spacing, animation timing, and more are all defined via adjustable variables.

There are too many options to discuss in detail within this document, but the styling options in `theme.scss` are grouped into annotated sections, and are named descriptively; see the `theme.ts` file [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/src/config/theme.scss) or in your code editor.

To get you started in a few different styling directions, you can try out any of the following theme options, all stored within `src/config/themes` in the Sketchbook [demo branch](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/tree/demo/src/config/themes).

_[todo: create a few different theme options, and add links and screenshots in this doc.]_
