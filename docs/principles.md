# Principles

_This document is a work in progress. Eventually it will contain a polished philosophical overview: The Sketchbook Way._

-   Start a project as quickly as possible: idea to pixels without losing a train of thought. Creative workflow optimized from the moment of first concept.
-   Create something that's inviting for others to play with. Collaborative creativity. Comprehensive and intuitive presentation out of the box, with options to enable even more functionality.
-   The parameters are a part of the art! Build a system, not a static outcome.
-   Configuration is optional. You can experience much of Sketchbook's potential without touching config files.
-   Create portable work. Easily carry your projects into another context (client work, etc) with minimal transportation cost (redesigning, rebuilding).
