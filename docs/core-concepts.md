todo: project anatomy, etc (reference design-doc.md)

# Common necessities:

-   time (in projects)
-   canvas size
-   mouse position & clicks

Note that it's running in the browser! So we generally have browser features (e.g. adding event listeners to this.canvas, for mouse movement or keypresses // todo: test this and include in demo projects)
