(readme could be the design-doc eventually, for now this is freeform)

Todo:

-   Validate canvas-sketch usage with current spec
-   Build into spec:
    -   Project types (Paths vs. Pixels)
    -   Experimental vs. published
-   Read through old notes and absorb in design doc

MVP stretch goals:

-

Long-term goals:

-   Midi control:
    -   Included in global configuration
    -   Enable
-   Fast switching:
    -   Optional (global config)
    -   Multiple canvases already instantiated
    -   Optional transition effects:
        -   Simple crossfade
        -   Alpha overlay for custom cutouts, wipes, etc
        -   Maybe a base Sketch class function called when transition begins?
