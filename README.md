# Sketchbook

Sketchbook is a development environment for HTML canvas artwork & prototypes. Sketchbook is also a portfolio webapp for publishing these projects. After creating a fork of this repository, you can use it to streamline your creative coding work, and then easily deploy a webapp to showcase your projects without any additional frontend work.

That's the vision! Sketchbook is very much a work in progress, but is under active development. This repo is public for perusal by any interested parties, but it's not yet ready for general use – I'll announce a 0.1.0 release when it's ready for beta users. Please let me know if you're interested!

My working notes and assorted project planning items are in [WIP.md](./WIP.md) for now. Documentation is in progress [over here](./docs/). If you're interested in the precursor to this project, check out my [original Sketchbook project](https://sketchbook.flatpickles.com).
