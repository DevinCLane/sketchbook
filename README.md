# Sketchbook v0.1

### [Docs](https://skbk.cc) // [Demo](https://demo.skbk.cc)

Sketchbook is a forkable development environment for HTML canvas artwork & prototypes. Sketchbook is also a customizable webapp for publishing these projects. After creating a fork of this repository, you can use it to streamline your creative coding work, and then easily deploy a webapp to showcase your projects without any additional frontend work.

Sketchbook is currently a work in progress! There are many additions and improvements on [the horizon](https://github.com/users/flatpickles/projects/2/views/1), and new minor & major versions will be accompanied by [release notes](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/releases). Any feedback on beta releases is _incredibly_ helpful – please [file an issue](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/issues/new) with any bugs, feature requests, or general notes. Thank you!
